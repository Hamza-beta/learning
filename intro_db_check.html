<h2>MySQL</h2>
<h3>Presentation</h3>
<p>
  MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS).Its name
  is a combination of "My", the name of co-founder Michael Widenius's daughter,
  and "SQL", the abbreviation for Structured Query Language. A relational
  database organizes data into one or more data tables in which data types may
  be related to each other. SQL is a language programmers use to create, modify
  and extract data from the relational database, as well as control user access
  to the database.
